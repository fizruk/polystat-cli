## Polystat v0.1.5

In this release the Polystat CLI was updated to use the latest version of j2eo (0.5.0).
Also, py2eo integration was updated to produce EO objects with valid names.  

> WARNING: This release does not have binaries because some of the Scala 3 libraries are not 
compatible with Native Image.
