## Polystat v0.1.10

This release mostly changes the structure of the files of the `tmp` directory.
The following changes were made:
* The generated `.eo` code goes into the `tmp/eo` subdirectory.
* The `.xml` XMIR files generated by EO parser from FaR analyzer go into the `tmp/xmir` subdirectory.
* The code read from stdin is written to `tmp/stdin.<ext>` where `ext` is the relevant extension (`.eo` for EO files, etc.)
* The code read from a single file is copied to `tmp/singleFile/<filename>`
